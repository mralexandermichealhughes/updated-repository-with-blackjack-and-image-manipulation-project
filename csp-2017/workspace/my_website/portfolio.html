The process of making the game on scratch with my partner bradley taught me many new things, coming into this class without much experience in coding. It taught me how to do basic coding, such as creating brodcasts to be received, setting up diffrent sprites to react when touching another sprite in a diffrent costume, and changing variables within the code to look like player health and whatnot. For being the first major project that was really done, we implemented many algortihms within it, for our main character, stalin, the bosses for the diffrent levels you travel to, china, korea, and poland, as well as the backgrounds for the title screen, game over screen, and many other bacdrops within. I learned that in a group project, everyone must bear an equal amount of the work in order to ensure success, and in doing this, we created a fully functioning game with a ton of logic within it. Our skills grew as we developed the game, overcoming coding obstacles and pushing onward to finally finish our game, and thus, allowing for our clients to play a fully functioning game with multiple levels, bosses, and a cool ending at the end for all the hard work we put in.

This app was a blast to make! The process of making this app was enjoyable with my partner Vincent, who had the same idea as me on making an app to read bedtime stories to children. This project taught me how to form the framework for an app, getting it all set up before we even got to the computer, having to make a chart that showed the different screens and their individual functions on paper, along with putting out ideas for sprints with each day we worked on the app. It taught me that setting an app up was no easy task, and that executing those tasks is even harder, as you have to translate the language of the computer program into app inventor so you can get it to do what you want for it to do, such as clicking a button to transfer from one screen to another, making buttons respond to being tapped and performing a certain task their assigned to, and working with the text-to-speech to get it to read stories. This project teached me how to make a basic app, and how to cooperate with others by sharing the workload, communicating with one another about problems we're having or something one of us is stuck on.

This text adventure was fun to make! Me and my partner Pedro had to cooperate with one another in order to create the text adventure, having to put ideas forward, come to an agreement on things, and implement the diffrent ideas we had into the text adventure. We had to plan ahead on what to make with gliffy, and transform those ideas into different pathways and coding, as well as different endings, and the real, actual ending. I learned how to use basic python such as if and else statements, and having to form print statements as well. This text adventure was a nice little entryway into the world of python.

The Repl.it project was created with python, and made with my partner Ryan. We would look up code for examples about what we wanted to do, used enthought to test out any code we had, made sure to use the version numbers as we updated our project. We maintained a respectful enviroment and shared the work, and i learned about making a nice little minigame with code, how to use random number generators to accomplish a goal, and involve a bit of math in my project. This was a cool project overall.

This image manipulation project was cool to make. The process was that we'd use the tutorials provided to us to help create the code for our project. I learned how to make the color of a picture change, thanks to RGB switching, and how to make the computer show that changed image twice or more if one wants to. One thing i managed to connect to the project from actual computer science, is how easily an image can be manipulated if one wanted to do so. My partner kind of helped on this project with me, though i found myself doing most of the coding. I mostly followed the tutorial in Enthought and tested my code there. All in all, this was enjoyable project that i got to learn from.
